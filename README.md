🏁 F1 Real-Time Driver Performance

This project is a computer vision and data visualization system that recognizes Formula 1 drivers via webcam, logs their attendance in real time using an API, and displays driver statistics, rankings, and performance analysis using a dynamic Streamlit dashboard.

🎯 Features

🔍 Face Recognition & Attendance Logging

Recognizes F1 drivers using KNN-based face classification.

Logs timestamped attendance via a Flask API.

Saves data to both .csv and .db files daily.

📈 Streamlit Dashboard

Real-time attendance updates.

Displays:

Driver statistics (wins, podiums, points, DNFs, etc.)

Visual charts:

Wins

Podiums

Fastest laps

Total points

DNFs

Conversion rates (win/podium, win/pole)

Fantasy-style leaderboard with normalized performance scores (0–100).

🧠 Fantasy Scoring Engine

Calculates driver score based on:

Wins, podiums, races

Win/podium conversion

Pole-to-win conversion

Points per race

Fastest lap frequency

DNF rate (penalty)

🎨 Custom Visuals

Overlays driver info, flags, and team logos on recognition screen.

Adds F1 branding (logo) on plots.

🚀 How to Run It
1. Create Virtual Environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    macOS (optional TTS): pip install -r requirements-macos.txt

2. Add faces 
    python addFaces.py

3. Start the Flask API
    python server.py

4. Launch Streamlit Dashboard
    streamlit run dashboard.py

5. Run Face Recognition
    python recognizeFace.py

✅ Tech Stack

Python (OpenCV, Streamlit, Flask, SQLite, matplotlib)

Computer Vision: KNN classifier + Haar Cascades

Data Viz: Bar charts, conversion metrics, fantasy scoring

TTS: pyttsx3 voice confirmation

🔌 Real-World Applications

This pipeline architecture — vision capture → embedding-based classification → 
API logging → live dashboard — maps directly to industrial use cases:
- Automated worker identification in restricted-access environments
- Real-time equipment/parts recognition on assembly lines  
- Edge-deployed perception systems requiring low-latency feedback loops

📦 Requirements

opencv-python
streamlit
matplotlib
pandas
flask
requests
pyttsx3
scikit-learn

🏁 Final Notes

This project mimics a real-world analytics pipeline: data capture (vision), storage (API + DB), and analysis (dashboard).

Ideal for portfolios, demo presentations, or expanding into ML-based driver behavior analytics.
